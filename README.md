# Written Report for the Pyber Project

## Overview of SurfsUp  Challenge 

- In this challenge we are working with W.Avy to open up an Ice Cream shop on the Island of Oahu. 

### Purpose

- We are doing a thorough analysis of the weather paterns on the Island to determine if an Ice Cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. 

## Analysis and Challenges

- We start our analysis in the month of June. Finding the temperature data using our tools, Python, Pandas functions and methods as well as SQLAlchemy. 
- The task is to filter the data provided through the hawaii.sqlite database and retrieve all the temperature for the month of June. 
- After we finished our analysis of June we do an additional analysis for the month of December.
### Analysis of Outcomes 

- After filtering through the database we have found that the average temperature for the month of June is 74.94F and the average temperature for the month of December is 71.04F.
- The minimum temperature for the month of June is a bit higher than the month of December, 64F vs 56F, as expected. 
- However the maximum temperatures do not vary much for the two months 85F vs 83F.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main challenge I had with this challenge was working through Flask in the module actually. Luckily the challenge did not included that type of coding so it was pretty straight forward thankfully. 

## Results

- The Data we have gathered show that there is not much temperature variation on the averages between the two months we were assigned to get data on. 
- So based only on temperature data, it shows that temperature is not a major concern on the investment of openning up an Ice Cream business. 
- However, there are other major considerations, such as percipitation for example that also play a huge part in a beach front business.
